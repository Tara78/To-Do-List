# To-Do-List
This app it is a single-page application user can add or remove a to-do list text. There is a drop-down next to the bottom where users can filter the complete, incomplete, and all tasks in the list.  

I used DOM in to create and decorate UI. 
In JavaScript, I used different functionality such as filter(to filter complete, incomplete, and all) on the to-do list App. 
I used animation regard to remove the complete task.
